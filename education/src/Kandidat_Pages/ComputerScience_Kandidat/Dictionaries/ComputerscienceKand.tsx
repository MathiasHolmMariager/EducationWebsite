  Beskrivelse: `Are you interested in programming, programming languages, software engineering, machine intelligence, 
    data management or embedded systems? You can deepen your skills in these areas by taking the Computer Science (IT) 
    master's education at Aalborg University.`,

  langBeskrivelse: `Computer Science (IT) is an education made for both Danish students and students from abroad (IT means “international track”) 
    and every part of the programme is taught in English. Please notice, that this education is not the same as the Computer Science 
    education which is only taught in Danish.
    <br><br>
    Computer Science (IT) targets two types of students:
    <br>- Bachelors in Information Technology with Specialisation in Technology from Aalborg University
    <br>- International students with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering
    <br><br>
    You are also able to be enrolled to the master's program in Computer Science (IT) if you have a bachelor's degree in 
    Data Science from Aalborg University, Aarhus University or the IT University in Copenhagen, or a bachelor's degree in 
    Interaction Design from Aalborg University. A special agreement has been made between Aalborg University and UCN, 
    so if you have a professional bachelor in Software Development and have completed courses in syntax and semantics 
    as well as discrete mathematics, you are able to be enrolled.
